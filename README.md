# SkyforgeAelinetScraper
A small linqpad script to scrape Aelinet of EU Skyforge for Pantheon Member statistics

This script was created out of a need to manage member's donations effectively. 

The script is run using the freely available and excellent tool called LINQPad (http://www.linqpad.net). Upon successful activation, it will display a table that can then be used as input for other purposes.

[A template sheet](https://github.com/Venomed/SkyforgeAelinetScraper/raw/master/Pantheon%20Data%20Statistics%20Template.xlsx) that we use in our own pantheon feeding off the above data is available for a jumpstart on analytics.
