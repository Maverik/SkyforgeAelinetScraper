# Skyforge Aelinet Scraper
A small linqpad script to scrape Aelinet of EU Skyforge for Pantheon Member statistics

This script was created out of a need to manage member's donations effectively. 

The script is run using the freely available and excellent tool called LINQPad (http://www.linqpad.net). You *need* to have LINQPad 5 or the script will not run as it is C# 6 code.

[LINQPad 5](http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx) requires .Net 4.6+ which can be downloaded here: [Microsoft .Net Framework 4.6.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981)

Upon successful activation of script, it will display a table that can then be used as input for other purposes.

[A template sheet](https://github.com/Venomed/SkyforgeAelinetScraper/raw/master/Pantheon%20Data%20Statistics%20Template.xlsx) that we use in our own pantheon feeding off the above data is available for a jumpstart on analytics.
